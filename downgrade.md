You can downgrade from A15 to A14. Don't try to go below May patch because anti-rollback will not allow you to downgrade.

## Steps-

1. Download A14 firmware file from Lolinet or any other source.

2. Flash it using tiny fastboot script or moto flash pro or manually by typing the commands.

3. Now, if yoy want to flash custom rom then do an OTA. (January security patch is not supported as of now).
